    "review": "Only popped in for a quick coffee with my 15 month old but first impressions extremely favourable - and I can see from other reviews that I am not alone. Very friendly staff, decent (aforementioned) coffee and a great albeit relatively small soft carpeted play area to keep little ones occupied. I would say that I’d be going back soon to try some of the other things that they offer however appears on their website that they have closed for the foreseeable future due to the Coronavirus.",

This was one of the most delicious paninis I’ve ever eaten. Happy to see good vegan options locally at last!!!",
